The rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria threatens public health globally more than ever before. Nearly 5 million deaths per year are related to drug-resistant bacteria while 1.27 million of the annual deaths are directly linked to the resistance to antimicrobials [1]. To cope with the burden of antibacterial resistance, the use of antibiotics needs to be improved, or new antibacterial compounds should be discovered. Even though the process has its own economic and scientific challenges, researchers (with different scientific backgrounds) from all over the world have been working diligently on the discovery of effective antimicrobial agents.  
In this blog post, I would like to explore how machine-learning approaches can help in the discovery of drugs in this case antibiotics. In their article, Stokes et. al. showed trained neural network model (DNNM) can track down a promising antibacterial molecule, halicin, by scanning numerous chemical libraries. I will review why and how they developed and applied a deep-learning algorithm in this manner.
